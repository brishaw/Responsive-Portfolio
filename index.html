                <p>I have a 4 year old son and have been a stay-at-home dad for the past 4 years, which has truly been a gift. My son Aidan has shown me just how much I don't know and he is truly everything I am about.</p>
                <p>I also have a German Shepherd named Jackson, who steps in for me when I can't find a suitable picture to use.</p>
                <p>Outside of trying to be 'daddy of the year(s)', I enjoy guitar, running and tacos. I have been in a few bands, ran a few marathons and indulged in burritos as 'big as your head'.</p>
                <p>I have a degree in Visual Communications which encompasses all of the different medias. I taught myself HTML years ago with notepad, before <em>progressing</em> to Micorsoft's Front Page (insert laughter here...) and have always had a passion for programming.</p>
                <p>I sometimes think that my brain can't decide which half it would like to dominantly use.</p>
